            <h3 class="typing-text">I'm a <span></span></h3>
            <p>I'm a second-year university student majoring in Information Technology. Almost two years in, and I've dived into everything from basic programming and web development to data structures, algorithms, and databases. Honestly, this major is a wild ride—one moment, it's melting my brain, and the next, I’m celebrating like a genius when things finally work!</p>
            <p>It's not just logic and problem-solving—I love letting my imagination run wild. I overthink everything, get lost in stories, movies, and even make up my own scenarios in my head. It's all about balancing reality and fantasy. In fact, I even came up with one:</p>
            <p><i>"In this world full of corruption and desire, just let yourself sink into the depths of darkness. Will you join me?"</i></p>
            <p>(I love being delusional, lol.)</p>
